	<h3>Computers are Magic</h3>
	<p>I'm in the middle of the south-western Utah dessert, just south of Zion National Park, and after waking up and chugging a liter of water, I walked around a bit trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I can't really watch youtube or browse the internet because my phone is always so close to dead; I didn't know what to do.<p>

	<h3>Sunrise in the Mountains</h3>
<p>My phone's battery is dead. I'm writing at our camp near the Larb Overlook in Dixie National Forest along Utah route 12. The clearing to our east presented the mighty landscape I recorded yesterday, and now frames a delicate allignment of the sun with a beautiful jurrasic landscape.</p>

	<h3>Tethered to Reality</h3>
<p>The sun will set in about an hour, the moon is trailing half a sky behind it. The La Sal mountains burst from the horizon about 50 miles to the south-east, a three-layer mesa sits to the west, ripped from the ground</p>

	<h3>Maximus</h3>
	<p><i>I'm sitting on top of a f***ing giant wild animal!,</i> I thought, riding a horse named Maximus, the tallest horse at Jesse James Adventure Park. My head was about 12 feet above the rocky forest path, and all my trust was in an enourmous wild animal that had its</p>

	<h3>Nashville</h3>
	<p>Music City didn't entail much music for us. We walked down Broadway, and expirienced some typical Nashvillian debauchery, but never really commited to entering the myriad bars with live music. Our stay did begin rather auspiciously with a small brunch at Woolworth's, where we had...</p>
