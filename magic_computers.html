<h2>Computers are Magic</h2>
<h5>by Tom</h5>
<img id='feature' src='damages/sunny_lap.jpg'>
	<p>I'm in the middle of the south-western Utah dessert, just south of Zion National Park, and after waking up and chugging a liter of water, I walked around a bit trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I can't really watch youtube or browse the internet because my phone is always so close to dead; I didn't know what to do.<p>
	<p>Then I remembered my trusty laptop! I scurried around, trying to find some shade to sit in, and (after failing to find any) opened her up and waited . The bootscreen is a faded gray, and in the glare I couldn't tell if it was working. I hesitated a moment, left clicked, and lo! The wonderful world of pixels had awakened before me. Like arriving in bed after a long journey, like setting foot on land after a voyage through the sea, the comfort and the stability of my sweet digital landscape aroused an awe for this machine that I hadn't felt since I was a kid.</p>
	<p>I think of the enthusiasm and the excitement I had for computers and electronics when I was growing up. Apple was making inspirational product videos, with sexy, dramatic animations of this new slab that you could touch and interact with-- that you could do anything on! It's so damn exciting, there's so much charisma! But the appeal wasn't just the drama and flashyness.</p>
	<p>The appeal came from the charisma of the creators, the masters of the magic. It wasn't just about beholding novel manipulations of atoms-- it was about acheiving that god-hood for myself. The careful planning the "visionary" design. (a href='visionary_apples.html' src='Apple liked that word')</p>
	<p>The commercials would show some amazing person, reading with a cup of tea in a well-designed home, or taking photos and tracking storms on a glacier. I was fantasizing about adventure, and using magic to make it happen.</p>
	<p>Now, I'm pretty anti-apple, but I must acknowledge the role they played in bringing cool technology to my life in the first place. The intuitive layout of iMovie 7 (the one that shipped with OSX Tiger in like 2007) allowed me to make some cool home-videos. That in turn gave me confidence in my ability to use these tools. Then self-identification as a tech-savy person sent me googling things, learning html for the first time, and trying to program.</p>
	<p>Now, I use Linix (which might perfectly antithesize apple's UI strategy) because the magic feels accesible. It seems more like engineering, because I know that I <i>can</i> access all the machinery, even if I don't bother most of the time.</p>
<h3>Magic Incantations</h3>
	<p>My first Computer Science Proffessor, Dr. Jeanna Mathews, used to call the headers to c++ files "Magic incantations" that you just need to say, without understanding them, so that the rest of the program will work. There is of course a lot of interesting machinery behind the seeming incantations, but without understanding the context (all the things we were learning in the programs) it wouldn't have been useful.</p>
	<p>I still chant incantations a lot when I use Linux, but unlike with Apple, I can expect to someday understand the underlying machinery.</p>

<meta id='outline'>
	-- computers are magical, they can do anything (and there are wizards)
	-- they work with magic incantations, charisma and marketing therein.
	-- Apple's magic incantations, and programming with an API.
		** how to make this an insightful conversations for newbies and oldies?
	-- at least linux gives the possibility of understanding. Linux encourages and amount of ownership.
