	<h2>Michael Abbott</h2>
	<p>Is a licensed bullshitter of the California State <abbr title="Bullshitters Association">BSA</abbr> as well as an avid fan of the Cincinatti Ravens, his favorite basketball club.</p>
	<p>He goes to school at the University of Bochester, Irving. Next year will be his last year there, after which Mike plans to continue procrastinating his life by going to grad school. He has many interests, and hopes that this blog will give him the platform he's always wanted to disseminate anti-vegan propaganda, and inform the brainless masses of the dangers of radon and carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

	<h2>Tom Dailey</h2>
	<p>Does not yet have a biography or an identity, as Mike will be giving it to him shortly. Don't fret though, he's going to copy and paste some stuff from around the internet.</p>
	<p>The first, that the vocabulary and the concepts of the work are spread throughout his corpus, leads me to the conclusion that Aristotle believed the framework he laid out in the Categories was complete; indeed any categorical statement (in the ordinary sense) presupposes a universality. But the categories are not intended as just one method, but instead as the unavoidable, necessary method (motivating the second observation).</p>

<h2>The Deal</h2>
<p>Mike and Tom are travelling the country this summer, and as an alaternative to telling the same stories over and over, it makes sense to just put them here! We will of course tell them to tose that are interested, but if you'd like to polished version, this is the place for you. Many thanks to those that are so interested. Your encouragement is invaluable. </p>
<h4>Check it out</h4>
<p>All the posts are linked to on the <a href='stories.html'>contents page</a>. Tom's working on a more ordinary feed for the home page. It's all a work in progress.</p>
<h4>And also,</h4>
<p>We're taking the summer to catch up on the things we want to read, and are consequently inclined to write and think about the things we're reading. For content-oriented stuff (philosophizing, and pontificating) check out <a href='ruminations.html'>ruminations</a>.</p>
