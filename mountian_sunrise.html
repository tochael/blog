<h2>Sunrise in the Mountains</h2>
<h5>by Tom</h5>
<p>My phone's battery is dead. I'm writing at our camp near the Larb Overlook in Dixie National Forest along Utah route 12. The clearing to our east presented the mighty landscape I recorded yesterday, and now frames a delicate allignment of the sun with a beautiful jurrasic landscape. I can't possibley describe how beautiful it is, nor could I photo all its richness and depth.</p>
<p>I missed taking pictures of the amazing sunset yestereday, and I'm missing pictures of an incredible sunrise. Maybe it's better not to capture this beauty. To have a picture would be suggest that an awesome moment could be recorded and expirienced later with sufficient authenticity. But that's never the case. Pictures can barely capture the moments of beauty that only the crazy amalgamation of states called earth can ever create.</p>
<p>Having a far view, to be able to scan the horizon and place oneself on a map, to feel and see the expanse of the earth around, to have proof that all the places on a map are actually real-- this is something I want to chase. These are rare, and magical moments when the world as we know it is at its edges, and unexpected forms present themselves, showing forth their sacred novelty before our incredulous eyes.</p>
<p>I'd like to sleep on mountains, so that I can go to bed with a view, and wake up with one. So many times have I slept in the outdoors with no motivations behind my placement other than flatness. It's such a natural human desire to be able to see far accross the earth, and to feel our place driven deep towards our identity. Why shouldn't I chase views like this for every sunrise and sunset? From what I've been told they each happen once per day.</p>
<h4>Sun Speed</h4>
<p>When the sun is this close to the horizon, you can percieve changes in its location more quickly. The shadow of night retreats up the mountains over the course of only a few minutes. The sun breaches the horizon and has fully emerged after just 10 minutes. Nowhere else in the sky can such small movements of the sun be made so apparant.</p>
<p>These landscapes at dawn and dusk are smattered with deep color, each hue placed precariously in the distance according to the fleeting trigonometry of the rising or setting sun. The precise hue lasts only a few minutes, too fast to go grab a camera or even alert your company to the exhibition of environmental beauty. The hazey, cinematic quality in the air fades as the sun finishes its arch thtough the thick atmosphere surrounding the horizon. An suddenly, as quickly as it begins, it has finished.</p>
