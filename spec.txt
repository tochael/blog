$$1: HOMEPAGE conventions and suggestions.

1- Follow the commented template at the top of the feed, order posts from oldest to newest.
2- Have a thumbnail with a smaller, more focused version of the feature photo.
3- by line?

TODO:
	-- make thumbnails smaller files. Github can't serve them fast enough.
	-- update thumbnails to conform with $$1.2
	-- add dates to posts
	-- an introductory blurb?


BIGGER:
	-- make an interface at @/$NAME with a form for making new posts easily (upload two pictures, give title, author and text in markdown)
	-- come up with a good $NAME
