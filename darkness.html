<h2>Darkness</h2>
<h3>By Mike Abbott</h3>
<p><i>Now this is darkness. At least when I close my eyes I begin to see those vague colorful patterns which give the illusion of some light, but my eyes are open now, and this is it; this is what absolute nothing looks like.</i></p>
<p>The Mammoth Cave system hasn't been explored in its entirety yet, but so far over 416 miles of cave paths have been documented, and today we toured about 2 of those miles. We felt the natural air conditioning as we approached the main cave entrance: an ominous hole that was surprisingly well-hidden given it's size. Our tour group of around a hundred people decended into the darkness.</p>
<p>The first half mile into the cave was spectacularly spacious. The ceiling hung 30 feet above us, and if we weren't required to stand on the narrow tourist walkway we could have fit 40 people side-by-side in this grand space. It was like a long cathedral, and we were informed that some church-goers used to actually hold their services here.</p>
<p>The cave was illuminated by large white, yellow, and red floodlights, but they would only illuminate the roughly 200 foot section we currently occupied, and as we moved forward, they would turn off the lights behind us. I strained my eyes to try to see the path we had just taken, but the cave's darkness was thick, and the space behind us was just a wall of black. At one stop, the rangers guiding us decided to "show us what the cave is like when people aren't taking tours." They turned off all the lghts and instructed us to be quiet. It was the darkest dark I have ever seen (or not seen?).</p>
<p>We continued navigating down 4 levels deep and through various formations, squeezing through "fat man's misery," looking down over the "bottomless ravine," and climbing up the stairs built in the center of Mammoth Dome. The longer we were in the cave, the more surreal it felt, being so separated from the outside world. I tried to imagine myself with the job of the cave's early explorers, who were often down here alone with just one oil lamp, held in their teeth as they crawled through tight spaces to discover these places we tour now. It feels like the closest our world comes to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy realm. Overall, and incredible experience.</p>
