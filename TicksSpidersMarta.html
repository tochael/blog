<h2>Ticks, Spiders, and Marta oh my!</h2>
<h3>By Mike Abbott</h3>

<p>Hoosier National Forest: The sign said "Be cautious of ticks. Cover the skin and avoid walking through brush. I didn't really listen, and I walked down the trail to the bank of the Ohio river in shorts and my tank top; it was covered in brush. <i>Well I've got long socks on, so I'll be fine.</i>Upon my return to the site, I did a tick-chec and found one hiding on the tongue of my shoe. I flicked it off and didn't think anything.</p>
<p>Mammoth Cave: After our cave tour, I finally removed the long socks I donned in Hoosier. What did I find underneath but little brwon tick with it's suckers stuck into my shin. I went to the visitor station and asked a ranger if it was the sort of tick I had to worry about. He didn't know, but I got the whole thing out in one pull, which he said made it unlikely I'd get sick from it.</p>
<p>North Carolina: I noticed a small bug bite on my right side.</p>
<p>Atlanta: On the last day of the conference, I had a light beer at lunch, and I immediately got a hug headache. I was definitely getting sick. By midnight that night I had the worst fever I've ever felt: my heart was pounding, and my head was on fire with a horrible headache. My ears were red hot to the touch, and my whole body felt like it had been beaten. The next day I still felt pretty awful. I checked the tick bite, which didn't look like anything, but I also noticed that the bite on my side had become a large rash with small ring of bruise-red color in the middle. It had two little marks in the middle, which is characteristic of spider bites.</p>
<p>I was worried that either the tick or spider bite was causing my sudden illness so I went to the doctor. Her conclusion: It didn't look like anything related to the tick or spider bite. In fact, it was probably a virus I picked up on the Atlanta Marta Train. So remember this: there are many dangerous critters and creatures in the US, which a traveller must be conscious of, but the most important thing to remember if you want to stay healthy is to wash your hands after being in that disease-ridden terrain known as public transportation.</p>
<p>P.S. My illness made us stay in Atlanta a couple days longer than intended, but I have returned to health and we are on our way.</p>
