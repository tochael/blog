<h2>The Explanatory Power of Route 40</h2>
<h2>Find Miles Wide!!</h2>
<h5>by Tom</h5>
<img id='feature' src=''>

	<p>Tennessee has a distinctly elongated shape, stretching about _____ miles east-to-west, and only about _____ miles north-to-south. We often forget how telling and how subtle borders are; places have their shape for fascinating historical reasons.</p> 
	<p>Some parts are quite easy to understand: the western border of Tennessee is the Mississippi River. No doubt, before there was infastructure in the west to get settlers accross the river (and before the US owned the land), the east side was as far as anyone could go. Thus, for a period of time, there was unity amongst settlers east of the river, and when the west side was accessible, that unity persisted, distinguishing Tennessee and Missouri thereafter.</p>
	<p>To the east are the Smokey Mountains, posing a large inconvenience to travel and a break in geographic continuity enough to convince me that a border somewhere in the mountains makes sense. This leaves the north and south borders of the state. Why is there a flat (and therefore geographically arbitrary) line separating Kentucky? And why another line to the South? </p>
	<p>On Sunday the 3rd, as we first got onto the interstate in Nashville heading towards Knoxville (and the Smokey Mountain NP) the GPS shouted out, "Continue on Intestate 40 east to Knoxville for 214 miles." Suddenly, a 40 Watt, incandescant lightbulb turned on above my head-- the mistery of the elongated shape of Tennessee, the inexplicable borders, the secret was revealed! The entire state lies within an hour's drive of route 40!</p>
	<p>I clumsily tried to explain my exasperated satisfaction with this fact to Mike, "The whole state is just Route 40!" He just thought I was crazy, and in my excitement I was inable to articulate its source. I brought it up several times saying, "I feel like I understand Tennessee so much better now." but he would only laugh.</p>
	<p>Even with four paragraphs, I'm having a hard time explaining exactly <i>what</i> Route 40 was explaining to me, because I must admit, I still don't really know why the north and south borders are what they are. But I can say that I-40 provides a decent kind of north-south unity that I hadn't previously seen. It isn't so much a feature of <i>containment</i> that unifies Tennessee to the north and south (as it does to the east and west), but of <i>support</i>. People didn't settle and fill in the west like syrup on a plate (seeping to the edges of its container) but more like a tree in a clearing (filling out the space from a central trunk). And the trunk is Route 40!</p>
	<p>The land was so barron, and the road to Memphis so long, that a people developed along this corridor, simpley because it was conveinient, and there was so much flat and accessible land that there wasn't much else to consider. At one time, I imagine the corridor was the precursor to I-40, but even now, the highway provides a link between just about everything in the state, cementing its identity of elongation in the minds of its citizens and its tourists.</p>
