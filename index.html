	<h3>Birdin' Around</h3>
	<p>Mike remembered that his pledge brother Konar lived in Nashville as we were struggling to find a cheep place to stay within the city. Not only did Konar have somewhere for us to stay, but it was a gorgeous...</p>

	<h3>Nashville</h3>
	<p>Music City didn't entail much music for us. We walked down Broadway, and expirienced some typical Nashvillian debauchery, but never really commited to entering the myriad bars with live music. Our stay did begin rather auspiciously with a small brunch at Woolworth's, where we had...</p>

	<p><i>Now this is darkness. At least when I close my eyes I begin to see those vague colorful patterns which give the illusion of some light, but my eyes are open now, and this is it; this is what absolute nothing looks like.</i></p>

	<p>It was like time travel both for us and for Tom's uncle Tom as he started showing us all of his old maps, books, journals and guides. Uncle Tom was no stranger to long cross-country road trips, so he was happy to hear that we were embarking on one of our own...</p>
