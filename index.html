<h2>The Deal</h2>
<p>Mike and Tom are travelling the country this summer, and as an alaternative to telling the same stories over and over, it makes sense to just put them here! We will of course tell them to tose that are interested, but if you'd like to polished version, this is the place for you. Many thanks to those that are so interested. Your encouragement is invaluable. </p>
<h4>And also,</h4>
<p>We're taking the summer to catch up on the things we want to read, and are consequently inclined to write and think about the things we're reading. For content-oriented stuff (philosophizing, and pontificating) check out <a href='ruminations.html'>ruminations</a>.</p>
