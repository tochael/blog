<h2>Arrival in the Allegheny</h2>
<p>From Rochester, south on 390, and through winding Pennsylvanian country (with only a breif extension to Dansville after missing an exit) we arrived in the Allegheney National Forest. </p>
The first 150 mile were put onto the car, an audiobook has been started, the prius bumper had its first stomach-twisting peck on the cheek with an unexpected rock; our trip has been chrsitened from all sides (though not with water, as it's been pleasantly dry).</p>

<p>We had to drive all the way through the Allegheny to get where we were aiming, a place we found on [freecampsites.net](http://freecampsites.net). We drove through towering and relentless woods, past logging centers and oil-processors, but also houses and small towns. There was a surprising amount of ordinary housing mixed in, further confusing our notions of a "National Forest". Having made our way to southern end, we laboured over navigating an area for which the crucial information contained on the map was covered by a symbol. Eventually we discovered the start of the road we wanted, only to find it was blocked. We looped around, to try approaching from the other end, and would've given up, biting our own second-rate, stingy bullets, had it not been for a kind resident. He was working in his yard, and seeing the Prius stop in her tracks and reverse to the intersection a hundred feet back, he approached us and offered the warmest, and most helpful assistance.</p>

<p>He sent us down the gravel road we were looking for, and a half an hour's bumping, rumbling ride got us into thte middle of logger's service roads, and in a wonderful, hidden compound beneath the trees and along the creek. We set up camp, and almost immediatly settled into our routine for the next two days. Roughly put: eat, read, chat, explore, chat, read, eat, chat, sleep.</p>
