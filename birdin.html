<h2>Birdin' Around</h2>
<h4>by Tom</h4>
<img id='feature' src='damages/mike_bird.jpg' />

<p>As we were struggling to find a cheep place to stay within the city Mike remembered that his pledge brother Konar lived in Nashville. Not only did Konar have somewhere for us to stay, but it was also a gorgeous 4-bedroom home with pristine hardwood, a well kept kitchen.</p>
<p>The owner of the house was living abroad for a few years, but wanted to return to her place, so she found a group of responsible young'uns looking for a place to stay. When one moved out, Konar interviewed to replace him. The highlight of the house is a particularly comfy couch in the family room, which was Reba Mcentire's until she graciously gave it to one of her assistants (and a tentant of this nashvillian oasis).</p>
<p>Konar grew up in the neighboring Clarksville, and has been going to school in the city, so he made a capable tour guide. We headed over to the west side, where we parked in conveinient garage and took a drunk-mobile to the Gulch (the gentrificated density rising tandem with the rest of the city). There, we found ourselves some bird scooters which we took accross the river and all around the Nashville area.</p>
<p>When we were done, Konar's mother was gracious enough to show us her appartment building (which deserves a post of its own) and eventually we found our way back in the jeep to move to the next place Konar wanted to take us. </p>
