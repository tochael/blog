<h2>Birdin' Around</h2>
<h4>by Tom Dailey</h4>
<img src='' />

<p>Mike remembered that his pledge brother Konar lived in Nashville as we were struggling to find a cheep place to stay within the city. Not only did Konar have somewhere for us to stay, but it was also a gorgeous 4-bedroom home with pristine hardwood, a well kept kitchen.
