<h2>Columbus</h2>
<h5>By Mike</h5>
<p>It was like time travel both for us and for Tom's uncle Tom as he started showing us all of his old maps, books, journals and guides. Uncle Tom was no stranger to long cross-country road trips, so he was happy to hear that we were embarking on one of our own. He pulled out several tucked away bins and began to pull out all of his old park maps from past hiking and biking trips.As he read the hand-made notes on the margins of these papers he began to relive the memories he had made years ago. He told us stories of nearly falling off canyon ridges on bycicle and avoiding moose on the trail. One time, in an act of environmental responsibility, he retrieved a beer can that was floating in an otherwise clear lake. "When I picked it up it was a full damn beer!" -- a beer which he proceeded to enjoy for the rest of his hike.</p>
<p>With Uncle Tom sufficiently transported to his past, we began to plan our near future. We learned about Moab, Utah--a town wedged right between Canyonlands and Arches National Parks. We decided these were must-sees. We also added the Wind Rivers Region in Wyoming as a tentative destination. Wyoming wasn't originally in our iternerary, but Uncle Tom could not say enough about how fantastic it was--it was the place he had visited the most.</p>
<p>Later in the evening we examined Uncle Tom's book collection, which was a fascinating combination of American History, Outdoor Guides, and books about the Grateful Dead. He gave us several books to borrow, including a book about bear attacks, which I can't decide if I ought to read. After hearing several more stories from Uncle Tom's travel journals, we went to sleep. In the morning, Tom worked on putting the blog together, which proved more difficult than either of us expected, and we didn't quite get it working. We set sail for Hoosier National Forest in Indiana!</p>
